A baseball league in an alternate timeline where some games for both teams are played at a road stadium, as a result of an environmentally sound society.

Created by Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) in June 2025. Eeshvar Das is the owner and creator of this repository that is licensed in Apache 2.0. Please remember to follow the Apache 2.0 open source license.

When both teams are playing a game at a road stadium, the series is played with alternating who bats first for each game in the series.

For development of this project to be committed to this repository at version 0.2 within the next 10 days, I have thought of a simple multi-agent simulation system that is made of two major parts, the alternate timeline environmentally sound agent, and the game simulation and league agents.
